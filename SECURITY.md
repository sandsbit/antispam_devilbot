# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Project is new and still in development, so all versions are supported
with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found and security problem or bug that may cause security
problems (e.g. CWEs), you can contact me via <<nikitaserba@icloud.com>>.
Problem will be analyzed and fixed soon.

Project is new and I'm a student, so I don't have enough money, that's
why I can't promise that you'll be rewarded if you find any security
problem. But, if you'll find very serious problem and I'll have enough
money, you'll be rewarded.
